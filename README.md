# ReDiscovery - Proof-of-concept for a virtual reality app for stroke recovery

This is the source code for ReDiscovery, a virtual reality application I built for my bachelor's degree in 2022. It's a proof-of-concept for an alternative therapy method for rehabilitating stroke patients through several minigames designed to stimulate their motor and cognitive skills, speeding up recovery. 

The project was built using the Unity Engine and features support for most virtual reality headsets. The project will run on Unity ver. 2020.3.31f1. Tested with a Oculus/Meta Quest 2 headset.
